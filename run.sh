#  @description bash script to run application quickly
#
#  the plan is to eventually have the application containerized
#  with commands from dockerfile, however the problem that we run into
#  is that the pocketbase executable is giving some issues
#
#  usage - bash run.sh
#	
#	 upon downloading the repository -
#  
#  cd server
#  npm install
#  cd ../client
#  npm install
#  cd ../db/pocketbase
#  wget https://https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases
#  			/download/v0.22.22/pocketbase_0.22.22_darwin_amd64.zip
#  unzip pocketbase_<version>_<platform>_<arch>.zip
#  chmod +x pocketbase
#  cd ../../server/services/aiy
#  pip install -r requirements.txt
#  cd ../../
#  touch .env
