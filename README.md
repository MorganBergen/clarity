####  `package.json`

provides metadata, dependencies, scripts, configuration, engines, versioning, and repository information for the project.  

metadata contains the `name`, `version`, `description`, `main`, `scripts`, `keywords`, `author`, `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `license` of the project

when cloning the project and running `npm install`, the dependencies are automatically installed and this ensures that the project has all the necessary libraries to run correctly.

the scripts define custom commands for the project, such as `start`, `build`, `test`, `dev`, by running `npm run <script>` in the terminal.

`npm start` runs the application in development mode, meaning that the application will run on `localhost:3000` and any changes made to the code will be reflected in the browser.

`npm test` runs the application in test mode, meaning it runs a test watcher in an interactive mode. 

`npm run build` builds the application for production mode, creating an optimized version of the application in the `build` folder.  essentially it bundles the app into static files for production

`npm run eject` removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory, this is an irreversible action and cannot be undone.
