####  `package.json`

provides metadata, dependencies, scripts, configuration, engines, versioning, and repository information for the project.  

metadata contains the `name`, `version`, `description`, `main`, `scripts`, `keywords`, `author`, `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `license` of the project

when cloning the project and running `npm install`, the dependencies are automatically installed and this ensures that the project has all the necessary libraries to run correctly.

the scripts define custom commands for the project, such as `start`, `build`, `test`, `dev`, by running `npm run <script>` in the terminal.

`npm start` runs the application in development mode, meaning that the application will run on `localhost:3000` and any changes made to the code will be reflected in the browser.

`npm test` runs the application in test mode, meaning it runs a test watcher in an interactive mode. 

`npm run build` builds the application for production mode, creating an optimized version of the application in the `build` folder.  essentially it bundles the app into static files for production

`npm run eject` removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory, this is an irreversible action and cannot be undone.

`npm` is a package manager for node.js, it allows you to install, update, and manage dependencies for your project.

`express` is a web application framework for node.js, its used to process the handling of http requests, api requests, and routing.

`pocketbase` provides real time databases, authentication, file storage, allowing you to store and manage user data, files, and other resources.

`nodemon` is a utility that monitors for any changes in the source code and automatically restarts the server, it helps with the development process by reducing the need to manually restart the server for every change.

`npx` is a package running tool that comes with npm, and allows you to run node.js packages without having to install them globally.

`create-react-app` is a used to create a single page react application and sets up the project with default configurations, including tools like webpack babel, eslint, and jest.

[`@mui/material`](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/) is a library of react components that implements google's material design, it helps with building a user interface with components such as buttons, text fields, and dialogs.

[`@emotion/react`](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) is library for writing css styles with javascript and provides flexible styling capabilities, its used as the default styling engine for material ui allowing for direct css usage.

[`@emotion/styled`](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) is part of the emotion library that provides a styled components like api for creating styled react components

[`redux`](https://redux.js.org/usage/#code-quality) is a state management library, it helps manage the state of the application in a predictable way.  it centralizes the applications state and logic.

[`react-redux`](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapstate) is the official binding library for react and redux, it allows for easy integration by connecting react components to the redux store, enabling them to read state and dispatch actions.

[`axios`](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is a library that helps with making http requests, it's used to communication with the backend apis, making it easier to send and receive data from the server.

##  Synopsis

####  Summary

Clarity is a web and mobile application that leverages image recognition and machine learning to analyze the nutritional content of food and comprehensive health management tool.  Designed to empower users with real time dietary insights and transform the way individuals manage their chronic conditions, nutrition, and overall health.

####  How it works

Users captures or uploads images or scan barcodes of their food using Clarity.  The app then provides comprehensive nutritional analysis, dietary trends, and provide personalized recommendations based on the user's health goals or chronic conditions.  Clarity can also predicts or mitigates disease risk factors, and allocates data for health care providers.  

####  Who benefits

1.  **Patients with Chronic Conditions** -  Clarity assist those needing dietary monitoring, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity.  Clarity can help patients manage their conditions and provide their healthcare providers with data to make informed decisions.

2.  **Insured Individuals** -  Users seeking to reduce healthcare costs will find Clarity invaluable for incentive programs that help reduce insurance premiums based on health data.

3.  **Athletes** -  Optimize performance and recovery with nutritional insights and recommendations.

4.  **Personal Trainers** -  To track their clients' progress and provide personalized recommendations to achieve their health and fitness goals.

5.  **Health-conscious Individuals** -  Anyone looking to enhance their well-being to make more informed dietary choices, track trends, prevent disease, and improve overall health.

##  Introduction

####  Background Information

[Most chronic disease are caused by risk factors such as poor nutrition and excessive alcohol use.](https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/prevention/index.html#:~:text=Most%20chronic%20diseases%20are%20caused,feeling%20good%2C%20and%20living%20longer.)  By avoiding these risks and receiving good preventative care Clarity can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

####  Problem Statement

The current healthcare system is intervention based and reactive.  Clarity aims to be proactive and preventative by providing users and healthcare providers with real-time data to make informed decisions about their health.

####  Objectives

1.  Nutritional Analysis and Insights
2.  Personalized Dietary Recommendations
3.  Health Monitoring and Trend Analysis
4.  Disease Risk Management
5.  Data Sharing with Healthcare Providers
6.  Reduce Healthcare Costs
7.  Support Athletic Performance and Personal Training
8.  Enhance Overall Health and Well-being

Nutritional Analysis and Insights -  Insights into macronutrient and micronutrient in take.  Inform users about carcinogens, pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, artificial additives, trans fats, acrylamide, and other harmful substances in their food.

Personalized Dietary Recommendations -  Help users meet specific nutritional needs, such as managing cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, or weight through personalized recommendations.  Provide users with meal plans, recipes, and grocery lists.

Health Monitoring and Trend Analysis -  Track dietary trends, allow users to log biometric data (integrated with wearables or medical devices such as glucose monitors, blood pressure monitors)

Disease Risk Management -  Use dietary data to predict potential health risks and offer preventive guidance to mitigate these risks.

Data Sharing with Healthcare Providers -  Allow users to share their nutritional data with healthcare providers by exporting reports into formats such as PDF, CSV, through API integrations, or HL7 (Health Level Seven International), CDA (Clinical Document Architecture), or FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards.

Reduce Healthcare Costs -  Incentivize users to reduce healthcare costs by providing data to insurance companies for premium reductions.

Support Athletic Performance and Personal Training -  Provide athletes and personal trainers with nutritional insights to optimize performance and recovery.

Enhance Overall Health and Well-being -  Empower users to make informed dietary choices, track trends, prevent disease, and improve overall health.

##  Project Description

Clarity will be using the following features to achieve the objectives of the project:

1.  User profile and data input

users provide their specific information, including age, gender, weight, medical history, medications, and other relevant health data.  the user can set specific health goals related to their dietary needs, such as managing diabetes, losing weight, or improving overall wellness.

2.  Mobile device image capture

users capture images of their meals using a mobile device.  the software should be user friendly and guide users on how to take clear and useful photos for analysis.

3.  Image analysis and nutritional data extraction

[ai powered analysis](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/) will consist of uploaded images to a desktop software where machine learning algorithms analyze the food items for nutritional content, portion sizes, and dietary composition.

The app allows users to scan the barcode of products, to view the product information, and to take and submit pictures and data for missing products. [ios app](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ios)
